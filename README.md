## double pendulum [simulation](https://dhruvnps.github.io/pendulum/)

> A double pendulum is a pendulum with another pendulum attached to its end. It is a chaotic system highly sensitive to its inital conditions. This simulation offsets the initial angle of the pendulum by a random value less than 0.1 radians giving a different pendulum path each time.
